In this project, I created a churn model by using artificial neural networks.
ustomer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service, also known as customer attrition. It is also referred as loss of clients or customers.
Having a predictive churn model gives you awareness and quantifiable metrics to fight against in your retention efforts.
Some examples of customer churn:
Cancelation of a subscription
Closure of an account
Non-renewal of a contract or service agreement
Use another service provider
